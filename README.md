# softmax-classification

Multi-class classification implemented using the SOFTMAX regressor in MATLAB. The classifier was used with the Fashion MNIST dataset, but can be used with any dataset. 

The main goal of this project is to highlight the difference between Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent in big data problems.


# Installation
1. Download the Fashion MNIST archive from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist) OR use any dataset you'd like, in CSV format.
2. Create a new folder /archive and move the contents of the dataset (train/test set).
3. Run the MATLAB file named softmax_classification.m.
4. Testing is made using CSV data or an image. To convert CSV file to image check the file named scriere_imagini.m .
